        <p>
         The Placement Automation System is used to grade multiple-choice content examinations given to all incoming students in the college.<br>
         Based on test results, the system makes recommendations for course placement and produces a number of different reports for various campus stakeholders.<br>
         The system is designed to replace a manual system created and used manually by placement officers. 
         The manual system has proved very valuable for its intended purpose but as an awkward user interface requires programming to make minor changes and relies on the academic mainframe computer.<br>
         Therefore, to remove all the above mentioned drawbacks we design new software which has following features-<br>
        <ul type="disc">   
	<li>Register</li>
	<li>Login/Logout</li>
	<li>Updating the studentâ€™s details</br></li> 
	<li>Searching</br></li>
	<li>Deletion</br></li>
	</ul>
        </P>
